## Deliverables

After reading the `game-project` prompt and the `game-project-api` documentation
please do the following and be prepared to share and discuss during our next
class.

Submit detailed answers to the following in this file via a pull request:

-   A wireframe of what your game project will look like.

-   The data structure you plan to use.
I am thinking it would be efficient to store my objects in JSON.

-   How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS
Using Arrays for each of the rows in the board.

-   How you plan to approach this project.
I plan to be methodical and very organized. I am starting my project by building
the wireframe using HTML. Then I want to add the javascript. I plan on spending
the most time making sure that all of the javascript works (making sure that I meet
the requirements there). Making sure that the users can log in and out. The last thing
that I plan on spending time on is the styling.

-   4-8 user stories for your game project.
1. User will be able to sign up
2. User will be able to sign in/out/change their password
3. User will be able to start a new game
4. User will be able to see who won the game

-   How you plan to keep your code modular.
I plan on keeping my code as dry as possible and avoid repeating myself.

-   What creative spin will you add to your project?
Adding my own unique styling.

-   How will you use version control to backup / track your project?
Commiting frequently to keep track of my progress.

-   Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?
I don't plan on it as I want to make sure that I can complete the project. If
I feel that I have enought time, I will definitely attempt it.

You may want to submit pictures for your wireframes and/or user stories.
